SCSA-16: PSI/O CONCEPTUAL ARCHITECTURE PCB LAYOUT (EDUCATIONAL)

This document describes the major conceptual blocks of the SCSA-16 hardware, essential for the PSI/O Secure Boot mechanism.

## 1. The 16-Bit Processing Core (CPU)

This block is where the F-D-E cycle happens.
* **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit):** Performs 16-bit arithmetic (+, -, *, etc.) and logical operations.
* **Registers (ACC, PC, IR):** 16-bit storage units for data (ACC) and instruction flow (PC).
* **Control Unit (CU):** Decodes the 4-bit Opcode to generate all internal timing and control signals.

## 2. Memory System (RAM/ROM)

* **Main RAM (64 KB):** Volatile storage for user programs and data (0x0000 to 0xEEFF).
* **PSI/O ROM/FLASH (Fixed Boot):** Non-volatile storage (0xF000 to 0xFFFF). This is the key component where the **Secure Boot Logic** resides, ensuring the system starts reliably.

## 3. Bus System (The Communication Channels)

* **16-bit Address Bus (MAR):** Carries the memory address from the PC or MAR register to the RAM/ROM blocks.
* **16-bit Data Bus (DBR):** Carries data between the CPU (Registers/ALU) and the Memory/I/O devices.
* **Control Bus:** Carries the timing and read/write signals from the Control Unit to all other components.

## 4. The PSI/O Interlock (Security Hardware Concept)

This is a conceptual hardware block specifically designed for SCSA-120, but simulated in SCSA-16.
* **Security Check Logic:** A dedicated circuit that performs the 7-step security check on the bootloader *before* allowing the Control Unit to execute the JMP instruction from 0xF000.
* **I/O Ports (0xFFF0 - 0xFFFF):** Dedicated addresses for communication (Input/Output). Writing to 0xFFFE displays the output; reading from 0xFFFF simulates user input.

**Educational Note:** The simplicity of the SCSA-16 architecture makes the relationship between these blocks easy to trace, which is why it's ideal for learning.
