# 🛡️ SCSA: Setting Computer Set Architecture

**SCSA** is an educational project and a complete **Architectural Lab** designed to explore computer architecture from the ground up (1-bit to 16-bit) and challenge modern security standards. The focus is on **setting** a new standard for secure system initialization.

## 🚀 The Future Vision: SCSA-120 (Hyper-Security Core)

The ultimate goal is **SCSA-120**, a revolutionary 120-bit architecture focused entirely on hyper-security. It introduces a **hardware-fused 56-bit Security Tag** within its 120-bit word, making its boot sequence theoretically tamper-proof.

### 💥 SCSA-120 Quantum Capacity Challenge

SCSA-120 issues a challenge to current computing standards: its **120-bit addressing** capability allows the system to address a staggering **2^120 bytes** of memory—a capacity that fundamentally exceeds the **10,000 TB** capacity limit often cited for practical systems and the current scale of operational quantum computers. This demonstrates the power of architectural **Setting** over simple scaling.
